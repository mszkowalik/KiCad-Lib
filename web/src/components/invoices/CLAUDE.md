# Invoice UI (`web/src/components/invoices`)

The invoice register and its line tree. The backend rules are in
[docs/reference/production-economics.md](../../../../docs/reference/production-economics.md).

## The invoice line "charge to" cell mirrors `line_destination`, never re-derives it

The destination cell in the Invoices line tree must cover every branch the backend's
`run_actuals.line_destination` can take: header → "shares below", pooled part →
"pool", **spread carrier (`allocate` by_value/by_qty with no run/project) → "pool
(spread)"**, excluded → the select's "nobody, on purpose", else the run/project
select. A missing branch falls through to the select and reads "— nobody —" for
money that IS charged (a landed-cost transport line spread into part prices looked
unassigned, user report 2026-07-28). When a new `allocate` value or destination
appears in the backend, add its branch here in the same change.
