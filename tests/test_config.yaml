# Global Validation Configuration
# This file defines global validation rules that apply to all component libraries.
# Library-specific rules should be defined in each Source/*.yaml file under 'validation_rules' section.

# Global required properties for all components
required_properties:
  - "Footprint"
  - "ki_description"

# Global properties that should have valid values (not empty)
non_empty_properties:
  - "Footprint"
  - "ki_description"

# Global property patterns
property_patterns:
  "Footprint": "^7Sigma:" # Must start with 7Sigma:
  "LCSC Part": "^C\\d+$" # LCSC parts should start with C followed by numbers

# Maximum length for property values (global default)
max_property_length: 200

# Footprint dimension requirements (all measurements in mm)
footprint_dimensions:
  min_drill_diameter: 0.3 # Minimum drill hole diameter
  min_via_size: 0.5 # Minimum via pad diameter
  min_via_drill: 0.3 # Minimum via drill diameter
  min_pad_size: 0.5 # Minimum through-hole pad size (SMD pads are not checked)
  thermal_via_warning_only: true # Thermal vias generate warnings instead of errors

# Global manufacturer information (at least one should be present)
manufacturer_properties:
  - "Manufacturer 1"
  - "Manufacturer Part Number 1"
  - "Supplier 1"
  - "Supplier Part Number 1"

# Warning thresholds
warnings:
  max_components_per_library: 200 # Warn if library has too many components
  max_unused_base_components: 5 # Warn if too many base components are unused
